# Shield System Documentation

## Overview
The shield system has been completely overhauled to provide immediate, responsive blocking mechanics with visual feedback and comprehensive debugging tools.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Immediate Activation ⚡
- **OLD**: 0.3-second delay before shield becomes active
- **NEW**: Shield activates instantly when right-click is pressed
- **Result**: Responsive, snappy shield activation

### 2. Improved Direction Calculation 🎯
- **OLD**: Confusing angle calculation that didn't work as expected
- **NEW**: Intuitive cone-based blocking system
- **Cone Angle**: 120° protection cone (60° each side of facing direction)
- **Calculation**: Properly handles attack source direction vs facing direction

### 3. Enhanced Visual Feedback ✨
- **Successful Blocks**: Blue screen flash + damage negation message
- **Failed Blocks**: Red screen flash (damage taken)
- **Shield Debug**: Detailed console output showing blocking calculations

### 4. Simplified State Machine 🔄
- **OLD**: "none" → "start" → "hold" → "end" 
- **NEW**: "none" → "active" → "ending"
- **Result**: Fewer state transitions, better responsiveness

## How to Use

### Basic Shield Usage
1. **Hold Right Click** to activate shield
2. **Face the attacker** to block incoming damage
3. **Release Right Click** to deactivate shield

### Shield Blocking Mechanics
- Shield blocks attacks within a **120° cone** in front of you
- Must be **facing toward the attack source** to block
- **Immediate activation** - no startup delay
- **Visual feedback** shows successful/failed blocks

## Debug Features

### Enable Shield Debug
```gdscript
# In-game: Press Enter to toggle debug mode
shield_debug = true
```

### Debug Output Example
```
🛡️ Block check:
  Facing: (1, 0)
  Attack source: (-0.707, 0.707)
  Angle diff: 135.0° (cone: 60.0°)
  Result: NOT BLOCKED
```

### Test Shield System
```gdscript
# In test scenes: Press Ctrl+S to run automated shield test
# Tests blocking from all 6 directions: front, back, sides, diagonals
```

## Configuration Options

### Adjustable Parameters
```gdscript
@export var shield_cone_angle: float = 120.0  # Degrees of protection
@export var shield_end_duration: float = 0.2   # Shield deactivation time
@export var shield_debug: bool = false         # Enable debug output
```

### Cone Angle Guidelines
- **60°**: Very precise blocking (expert mode)
- **120°**: Balanced blocking (recommended)
- **180°**: Easy blocking (beginner friendly)

## Visual Effects

### Successful Block
- **Blue screen flash** (Color: 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 0.4)
- **Console message**: "🛡️ Attack blocked by shield! (X damage negated)"
- **Player feedback**: "✨ Blocked X damage! Well done!"

### Failed Block
- **Red screen flash** (standard damage effect)
- **Debug message**: "🛡️ Shield active but attack not blocked - check direction!"

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Shield feels unresponsive"
- ✅ **FIXED**: Shield now activates immediately (no 0.3s delay)
- Check that you're holding right-click consistently

### "Shield doesn't block attacks"
- Check attack is within 120° cone
- Enable `shield_debug = true` to see calculations
- Ensure you're facing toward the attack source

### "Visual feedback missing"
- Check that `damage_flash` UI element exists
- Verify `_trigger_block_flash()` is being called

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing
1. Run the game in test scene (`AITest.tscn`)
2. Press **Ctrl+S** to run automated shield tests
3. Enable debug with **Enter key** for detailed output

### Automated Test Results
```
🧪 Testing shield blocking system...
🎯 Testing attack from Front: BLOCKED ✅
🎯 Testing attack from Behind: NOT BLOCKED ❌  
🎯 Testing attack from Above: NOT BLOCKED ❌
🎯 Testing attack from Below: NOT BLOCKED ❌
🎯 Testing attack from Diagonal Front: BLOCKED ✅
🎯 Testing attack from Diagonal Back: NOT BLOCKED ❌
✅ Shield test completed!
```

## Implementation Details

### Key Functions
- `_start_shield()`: Immediate activation
- `_can_block_attack()`: Cone calculation with debug
- `_on_successful_block()`: Visual feedback
- `test_shield_blocking()`: Automated testing

### State Flow
```
[none] → Right Click → [active] → Release Click → [ending] → [none]
         ↑ INSTANT           ↑                     ↑ 0.2s delay
```

## Performance Notes
- Cone calculation is lightweight (simple dot product)
- Visual effects use existing tween system
- Debug output only when enabled
- No impact on gameplay performance
